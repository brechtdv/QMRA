Description: The QMRA package provides a suite of functions for performing exposure assessment, dose-response assessment and risk characterisation in the context of microbial risk assessment. Different parametric models are available and can be fitted in both a maximum likelihood and Bayesian framework. IMPORTANT: the Bayesian methods in the QMRA package call on JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler), which therefore has to be available on the user's system. JAGS can be downloaded from http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/
